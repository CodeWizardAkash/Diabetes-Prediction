# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using SVM

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic based on health-related parameters. It includes a Gradio web app for live predictions and saves the model and scaler for deployment.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 SVM model for classification
- 📊 Data standardization with `StandardScaler`
- ✅ Model evaluation with accuracy score
- 💾 Model saved as `model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`
- 🌐 Gradio web interface for easy predictions

## 📂 Files
-`Dataset.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving `.pkl` files.
- `diabetes.py` – Python script version of the notebook for training and saving the model.
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset
- `model.pkl`: Trained SVM model
- `scaler.pkl`: StandardScaler used for preprocessing
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies
